<h1>Welcome to the Aluminum Age</h1>
<p>This is an open, <i>pay as you feel</i> type of project. (Yes. That means you may pay $0 if you feel like it.)
You may download the files and use them for your needs and creations as long as you wish.
Of course you may sell your own products and designs that are produced by these machines as well.
Although, you're not allowed to sell ALUMI designs themselves.</p>
<p>You will find the latest design files that are published and instructions for
these individual projects at the respective links on the left side.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage people to make their own tools no matter their creative fields are.
Whether it's for hobby purposes or professional use;
we are happy to provide you an alternative or at least an inspiration to build upon.
</p>
<p>We believe, reliable tools are needed in order to produce better final products.
Once you put them together, these machines will enable you to work without too much hassle or waste.
As aluminum extrusion and plasma cutters are widely available around the globe;
we decided to put aluminum at the core of our design concept.
</p>
